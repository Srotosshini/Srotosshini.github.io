# ✨💙 Solace 💙✨

Welcome to **Solace** – a personal space for self-care tools to combat burnout and find solace. 💙🦋✨

I’ve been feeling academically burnt out at NYU Abu Dhabi, so I created this site to find comfort in moments of distress. The word *solace* means comfort in tough times, and that’s what this website aims to provide. Journaling, checklists, and old photos help me unwind, and I hope you’ll find peace here too. The design features calming sky blue and navy blue shades – my colors of comfort. 💙🩵✨

## 🌼 Process

When I first designed my wireframe, I had just gotten into the Comm Lab class from the waitlist, so I was pretty new to all of this! 😅 My final website ended up being quite different from what I originally planned. At first, I was set on making a fake mental health website, but then I realized I wanted it to feel more *me*. 💙 So, I changed course, and now the site reflects something really personal – my own struggles with burnout and, most importantly, the ways I find to manage it. 🦋✨

I decluttered the layout, moved the social links to the side, and got rid of dropdowns so the video could really *shine*. 🌟 Plus, I made the hover effect nice and soft – no flashy distractions here! 💫

## 🎬 Video Facts & Acknowledgments

The video was created in under 30 minutes as part of the **30-Minute Film Festival (30MFF)** project. 💙✨

Big thanks to:
- **Dawid** for helping me film
- **Mariam's alarm clock** for being a perfect prop
- **My parents** for posing for some of the footage
- And many more small contributions that made this project come together! 💫⭐️

while most of it was hand-held, I did use a tripod for a few shots.

## ✨ Features

- **Journaling Section** 📝: Write your thoughts here. The site reminds you to take a picture of your journal if you'd like to save it. Since no data is stored for privacy reasons, it's a temporary tool to help you focus on mental health in the moment. 💙🦋
  
- **Mood Tracker** 🌈: Track your mood with a slider and reflect on how you're feeling over time. It's a simple way to monitor whether you're burnt out or taking good care of yourself. ⭐️

- **Memory Lane** 📸: Upload photos temporarily into cute polaroid-style frames. These prompts are designed to stir nostalgia and reconnect you with cherished memories. 💫

- **Self-Care Checklist** ✔️: Use this interactive checklist to remind yourself to take care of daily necessities. The design adds a little joy as you check off each task! 💙✨

## 💭 Reflection & Evaluation

Learning three programming languages in one week was intense! 😅 While I didn’t meet all my initial goals, I’m proud of what I accomplished. This project is personal, creative, and reflects a part of me. 🩵💫

I had to make several adjustments to my wireframe to better accommodate visitors:

- The dropdowns from the header were eliminated to ensure the video did not get blocked, allowing a smoother viewing experience. 🦋
- The social media links were moved to the left side for better user-friendliness and easy navigation. ✨
- The video hover effect was removed to avoid any issues with photosensitive epilepsy, keeping the interface safe for all users. ⭐️
- The trigger button for the video was removed since it's embedded from YouTube and needs to be played directly by the visitor. 💙
- The chatbot was placed on the bottom right of the page to ensure it didn’t block the main content or interfere with viewing the site. 💫

## 🎨 Why the Design is the Way It Is

- **Use of Blue**: Blue is a visual representation of calm and coolness for me. It’s also my favorite color, so naturally, I find solace in it. I wanted to create a monochromatic palette with sky blue and navy blue shades to give off a peaceful and serene vibe. 💙🩵
  
- **Simple Open Sans Font**: I chose Open Sans because it reflects simplicity and calmness rather than something loud or bold. The website is all about finding peace, so the font aligns perfectly with that purpose. 💫
  
- **Big Buttons**: The buttons on the site are large to enhance user-friendliness. I wanted the experience to be smooth and intuitive, ensuring that visitors can easily navigate and interact with the tools on the site. 🦋✨
